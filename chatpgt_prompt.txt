Given a text, I want to generate a question, a correct answer, and 2 or 3 several distractor answers. A distractor answer is a wrong but plausible answer that is meant to confuse a student or user. When reading the question, the correct answer and the distractor answers, the text must be necessary in order to answer the question correctly. I will give you a text, and you should try to generate a question, with its correct answers and 2 or 3 distractor answers. A requirement is that the correct answer and the distractor answers, must be found in the text, you can't make up the distractor answers, they need to be found inside the text. The correct and distractor answers can be proper names, numbers, dates, short phrases (1-4 words) and also long phrases. The text will be in Spanish. You will provide with 3 different sets of questions, correct answer and distractors. Do you understand the task?
